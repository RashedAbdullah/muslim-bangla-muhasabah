# Bangla Muslim Muhasabah

**Bangla Muslim Muhasabah** is a tool designed for self-reflection and spiritual growth. The project provides a structured approach for Muslims to review their actions, habits, and progress in various aspects of their religious practices, including knowledge (Ilm), Dawah (inviting others to Islam), and Sadaqah (charity). This tool helps individuals track their efforts, evaluate improvements, and focus on areas that require development.

## Features

- **Dawah (Inviting to Allah)**: Monitor your daily Dawah efforts and measure your progress in spreading the message of Islam.
- **Sadaqah (Charity)**: Keep track of your charity donations and observe the improvements or setbacks over time.
